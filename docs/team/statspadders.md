### Project: MODcheck

MODcheck is a desktop app to allow students to easily check the module coordinators, professors and teaching
assistants in the modules they are taking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Add Command
    * What it does: Allow users to add a new field MODULE_TAGS
    * Justification: This new field would help users keep track of module-specific tags or could be used to further differentiate between individuals or groups involved in the same module.
    * Highlights: The added benefit of having module tags in a vibrant orange color can also make the user interface more vibrant and visually appealing which further helps to organise ModCheck.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Add Command
    * What it does: Keeping the field NAME as the primary requirement, and remove the mandatory requirement of all other fields.
    * Justification: In our daily lives, it is difficult to have complete contact information for individuals. It is a poor idea if ModCheck prevents someone from adding a person's contact information because he is lacking a required field.
    * Highlights: Allow users to add contacts to ModCheck in a swift !
    * Credits: Thanks to Joel for suggesting this issue.
